We all know a shopping center will not dig up security footage for such an issue and that the footage would have been recorded over by the time traffic court case arrived.

It's very convenient to just tap my watch against the station rather than dig out my wallet. I found out this doesn't work with USbank cards, though.  I called and apparently USbank says they block Chargepoint and nobody there knows why.  My Huntington card worked just fine.",Positive

I'm not sure if he is confused doesent grasp the concept is is really slow, I don't mean that in a bad way I just want to understand his logic. It makes no sense. Today it went something like this "" Hi I am here to chage"" SECURITY: The fast charger? ME: Yes, if it's open.  SECURITY: Well it's not ME: Okay well I'll use the slow chager SECURITY: well you can't? ME:Why not? SECURITY: Because you wanted to use the fast charger and it's busy. ME: Okay, but now since I've only got 4miles I have no choice but to use the slow charger SECURITY: I'm sorry but you can't charge. ME: OMG please I need to charge. SECURITY: well I don't know what to tell you. SECURITY: PLEASE sir I am begging you to please let me use the slow charger.              Okay so I go and plug in, sure enough someone is charging on the fast charger and someone is charging on the slow charger waiting for the fast charger. The man in the fast charger is done  the other guy moves in I wait for the other guy, he finishes, I plug in its all good, community ,self management all good. Then comes a man, ""I got a the pass for the fast charger"" Excuse me? ""I got the pass for the fast charger, you wrong man you wrong"". What is he talking about ? Anyways I suggest he plug in to the slow charger whilst my sessions is complete. Did he? No he chose to wait outside!  Just sat there in the heat for no reason but to wait for the fast charger. Lord love a duck.  Here comes the good part.  Upon exiting the security guy says ""you waited for the fast charger, you cannot do that  you wan the fast charger you gotta go in and come back out, someone might want to use it"" what? Is he talking about? He's so confusing, then the guy that waited outside starts telling me "" I wanted the fast charger, yeah I wanted the fast charger"" I said to him well you waited, you may as well used the slow charger while you wait for the fast charger that's way you are still charging, his reply "" I came to use the fast charger"".

He said that the Nissan Leaf wasn't fully charged and that no one had driven it that day and that he had just plugged it in 5 minutes ago, so that along with the fact that both times I saw the Leaf it was plugged in and not charging made me think that he didn't know how to use the charger (all you have to do is press the start button).",Negative

When I insisted on going in the garage, I found my charge cable and saw that it was never plugged into--anything. The night attendant never notified me of his problem.

6265,284285,"The South Coast AQMD in Diamond Bar, CA, IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY TO PUBLIC USERS of their chargers.    Here's my observation:  I have been charging here for the past five weeks. I leave my EV here from 1am-5am, then pick up my EV before business hours. I live 1 mile away from the facility, and can easily jog or use my bicycle to travel between SCAQMD and my home.    There were a few instances when I was not able to pick up my EV after it had completed charging.  Those few times when I picked up my EV during business hours (ranging from pick up times of 6:30 AM, up to 11:00 AM), I had received hard stares from both the security guard (located at the solar array area, where some of the charging stations are located), and from what appeared (at the time), to have been from an employee of SCAQMD _‹ÓA man in clear lens glasses, who wears a company badge, khakis, and a white, tucked-in shirt.    I have been wondering why I was the recipient of hard stares, and I believe I now know why.     According to a public document by South Coast AQMD, on their web site, (at web site address:  http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/Agendas/Governing-Board/2014/2014-may2-007.pdf), and I quote,  _‹ÐInitially, the charging infrastructure was more than adequate to supply PEV charging requirements of SCAQMD_‹_s staff and its vehicle fleet, the public and SCAQMD Board members. Since the initial installation of EVSE at SCAQMD headquarters, national sales of PEVs have increased 600 percent. At SCAQMD headquarters, it is estimated that 70 PEVs are typically present during business hours. The large number of PEVs  requires drivers to closely monitor their vehicles_‹_ state of charge and rotate vehicles between charging spaces and regular parking spaces. Unfortunately, even with vehicle rotations, many PEV drivers have difficulty gaining access to charging during working hours._‹    Be warned:  SCAQMD may not currently have the capacity to provide public use of their EV charging stations anymore, based on my month-long observations.    Your experience may vary, but take note of the following web site, which indicates that EV chargers at SCAQMD, in Diamond Bar, California, are free for public use:  http://www.energy.ca.gov/tour/evcharging (Quoted directly from the web site, _‹ÐSCAQMD installed twenty Level 2 chargers and one direct current (DC) fast-charger, all of which are available to the public twenty-four hours a day, with no fee for using the Level 2 chargers._‹    My next question then is, are there any signages that are at the Diamond Bar SCAQMD location, that prevents or restricts public use of their free chargers?  If so, where are the signages, and are there currently any restrictions for public use the EV chargers?    A hard stare is not the best way to communicate current policies regarding public use of South Coast AQMD.  I believe, there are better solutions that not only reinforce and exemplifies SCAQMD_‹_s commitment to cleaner air quality in its service area, but also more effective means to communicate updated policies in regard to public use of EV charging stations at the Diamond Bar headquarters.",Negative

I used it to charge twice (there and back). If you have the caljones, the padlocks on all of them can be easily circumvented by simply unscrewing (you can use your fingers) the bolts on the left and right side to remove the bottom panel. Since the top and bottom panel are padlocked together, you can then open the top panel and access everything inside.

Similarly, Ugostations CHAdeMO chargers also had free introductory period for many months last year without membership card. That is not the same here, so I left a comment to warn others about this requirement so that they don't get stranded, if they think this is the same as Brooklyn and other places.

I was on the phone waiting for help for over  45 minutes twice. They also suggested I call the nearest Nissan dealer even though I drive a Kia.  In the end I pushed the bottom lever downward and shoved the unit further in. This entire process took over 90 minutes!!! It made me late  for work as well as driving me nuts!!! Lesson learned ;  Do not use the silver  Chademo on a Kia. It's not built for it.  Use the blue one.  Also :  using the fast charging is much more expensive than using a level 2.,Negative

8188,279151,"The EV-Link was apparently functional when I tried to charge on 25th July however after 15 minutes or so the unit went off line on the side I was using and would not come back on. I tried the other plug and the same thing happened. Being stuck without charging capability is not a good thing.     The hotel staff were king enough to let me try the 110 volt wall outlets near the EV-Link unit. the same problem happened there as well the charging stopped after a short period. I thought my car might have a problem, but I was able to charge normally the next day at Ithica Yards and at the Supercharger in Syracuse.     I believe there is a ground fault or moisture problem with the Hotel's power. I told the staff this and they will be following up with an electrician.     The next morning the Hotel had the fuses inside the EV-Link connection to their power grid replaced and I was able to charge. Although the EV-Link unit is rated at 30 Amps, as a precaution I lowered my charging amperage to 25 from 30. I was able to charge for nearly 2 hours before my departure.    Three recommendations if you plan to use this site to charge:    1) Call the hotel first to see if the system is working well over the last few days. The staff are VERY helpful and really want to make this work.  2) Have a back-up plan in mind.  3) Lower your charging amperage to prevent any fuses popping!",negative
